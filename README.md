# Bouncing Ball Obstacle Game

## Overview
The Bouncing Ball Obstacle Game is a simple yet challenging game written in C++ using the graphics.h library. Players control a bouncing ball, navigating through obstacles by timing jumps correctly. The game increases in difficulty as the player's score increases by speeding up the obstacles.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the game, you need a C++ compiler that supports graphics.h, such as Turbo C++ or a setup with the WinBGIm library in Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. If using Turbo C++, copy the files into the BIN folder of Turbo C++ directory.
3. Compile and run the `BouncingBall.cpp` file.
4. Use the space bar to control the ball and avoid obstacles.

## System Requirements
- Windows OS (recommended: Windows 7/8/10)
- Turbo C++ or any modern C++ IDE that supports the WinBGIm library (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks)

## Controls
- **Space Bar:** Jump

## Features
- Dynamic obstacle speed increases as the score increases.
